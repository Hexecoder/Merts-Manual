## Terms

- DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology)


- Block
A single section of discrete data. Blocks typically comprise a list of transactions or actions to be performed when processing the data in the block.

- Decentralization
The movement of data, actions, and other interests away from a single actor in favor of distribution amongst all actors.

In a decentralized system, no actor or group of actors can control the system without the consent of the rest of the actors.
