# Network

### Internet(Inter Network)

### WAN(Wide Area Network)

### RAN(Radio Access Network)

### MAN(Metropolitian Area Network)

### CAN(Campus Area Network)

Larger than LANs, but smaller than metropolitan area networks (MANs, explained below), these types of networks are typically seen in universities, large K-12 school districts or small businesses. They can be spread across several buildings that are fairly close to each other so users can share resources.

### LAN(Local Area Network)
We’re confident that you’ve heard of these types of networks before – LANs are the most frequently discussed networks, one of the most common, one of the most original and one of the simplest types of networks. LANs connect groups of computers and low-voltage devices together across short distances (within a building or between a group of two or three buildings in close proximity to each other) to share information and resources. Enterprises typically manage and maintain LANs.

 

Using routers, LANs can connect to wide area networks (WANs, explained below) to rapidly and safely transfer data.


PAN(Platform Area Network)
The smallest and most basic type of network, a PAN is made up of a wireless modem, a computer or two, phones, printers, tablets, etc., and revolves around one person in one building. These types of networks are typically found in small offices or residences, and are managed by one person or organization from a single device.
